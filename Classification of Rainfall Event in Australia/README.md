# Classification of Rainfall Event in Australia
-----
The case of this project is the weather in Australia. Weather conditions greatly affect people's daily activities. Often the weather experiences erratic changes such as sunny today but the next day it rains, which can interfere with and even stop the activities being carried out. Therefore, a model is built to predict tomorrow's weather, more precisely to predict whether it will rain or not. The construction of this model will involve several variables that are considered to affect the calculation of whether it will rain tomorrow or not. This model is expected to help the Australian community to predict rain so that it will better help them prepare themselves.
