# Predicting Uber & Lyft Ride Price in Boston, MA
-----
The case raised in this project is the price of online transportation for Uber and Lyft. Online transportation has an important role in mobilization in an area. Online transportation makes it easier for people to get transportation because the booking is done online. In addition, online transportation can also record prices based on the distance from the pick-up point and destination point. However, in everyday life, we often encounter situations where the price of online transportation changes. This causes an increasing need for online transportation.

Using this data, a model will be built where feature data (independent variable) and label data (dependent variable) are used to train the model to be able to make predictions of transportation prices or bills (output is a continuous value) using the linear regression algorithm.
