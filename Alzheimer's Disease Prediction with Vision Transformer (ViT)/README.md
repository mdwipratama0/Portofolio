Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the volume of the brain's hippocampus and cerebral cortex shrinks, causing dementia conditions such as decreased ability to solve problems, decreased memory, and difficulty speaking in a person. There are several factors that can increase a person's risk of developing this disease such as lack of physical activity, smoking, obesity, diabetes, malnutrition, brain injury and age.

According to World Heath Organization (WHO) data in 2017 there was a dynamic increase worldwide in Alzheimer's disease with an estimated 46.8 or 50 million diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia and a total growth of 10 million new cases every day. In Indonesia alone, the number of people suffering from the disease reached 1.2 million in 2016, and this number is expected to increase to 2 million by 2030. The disease can be detected by performing an MRI scan on the brain and the results of the MRI will be diagnosed by a radiologist. But unfortunately, according to the Public Relations of the Faculty of Medicine UI in 2021 there were only 1646 radiologists in Indonesia serving more than 270 million Indonesians. 

Therefore, in this project a model is built that can predict the stage of Alzheimer's disease quickly and accurately. It is hoped that this project can help medical personnel, especially radiologists to diagnose patients so that the treatment process can be carried out as early as possible.
