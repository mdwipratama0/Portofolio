# Heart Failure Prediction
-----
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number 1 cause of death globally, it is estimated to claim 17.9 million lives each year and accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVD and the dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict death from heart failure. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful alcohol use. People with cardiovascular disease or those at high risk require early detection where machine learning models can be very helpful.

The achievement of this project is to be able to understand the concept of Classification with Ensemble Model, prepare data to be used in Ensemble Model, implement Ensemble Model to make predictions.
